Our main report is in Final_project_report.ipynb

The following packages are needed to run our code.  We strongly suggest you install using conda:
conda install shapely
conda install pyplot
conda install geojson
conda install geojsonio
conda install folium

We kept the other notebooks around for archival purposes.  We cannot guarantee they will run without intervention.
